> Stardew has gotten me through some of the worst depression I have ever been in. It's a "cozy" game but it does everything right. It's gentle, it's easy to play in the background, it's relaxing, it's not *completely* insultingly unchallenging. It's a fun, sweet little game. You already know all this though don't you?

> This is one of the best games ever made by one person, Eric Barone. At first, I didn’t understand why people got hooked on it, but you have to be patient and enjoy building your farm over time until you want to unlock everything. Or you can give up and play something else that takes less time to reward yourself.

## ここがおもろい！

この『Stardew Valley』は、ほんまに心の癒しやで。プレイヤーたちが「辛い時期を乗り越えさせてくれた」って声が多いんや。コージーな雰囲気でリラックスできるし、背景でプレイしやすいから、日常のストレスを忘れさせてくれるんやな。難易度も絶妙で、全然やりがいないわけでもないから、ちょうどええ感じやで。

エリック・バローネが一人で作ったゲームってほんまにすごいわ。最初は「何がそんなにおもろいん？」って思うかもしれんけど、じっくり農場を育てていく過程がまた楽しんや。全てを unlock するには時間がかかるけど、その時間を楽しむのがポイントやねん。すぐに結果を求めるんやなくて、マイペースで進めるのが大事なんや。

このゲームは「無料のセラピー」って言われるぐらい、リラックス効果が抜群や。何年も色んなプラットフォームで遊んでる人が多いみたいやし、ほんまにおすすめやわ。興味があるなら、迷わずプレイするべきやで！
